# Bank Note Classification 💵
##### Data Set Information:

Data were extracted from images that were taken from genuine and forged banknote-like specimens. For digitization, an industrial camera usually used for print inspection was used. The final images have 400x 400 pixels. Due to the object lens and distance to the investigated object gray-scale pictures with a resolution of about 660 dpi were gained. Wavelet Transform tool were used to extract features from images.

##### Attribute Information:

1. Variance of Wavelet Transformed image (continuous)
2. Skewness of Wavelet Transformed image (continuous)
3. Curtosis of Wavelet Transformed image (continuous)
4. Entropy of image (continuous)

##### Output:
1 - Fake Note

0 - Genuine Note

### Training the model
I have trained the model using a simple MLP in PyTorch. You can find the code [here](https://github.com/ibadrather/deep_projects/tree/main/FastAPI_Deployment/2_deploy_dl_app).

Then I converted the trained model to ONNX format and used it in this app. You can find the code [here](https://github.com/ibadrather/deep_projects/tree/main/FastAPI_Deployment/2_deploy_dl_app).
